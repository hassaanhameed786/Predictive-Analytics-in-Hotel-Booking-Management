1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
 Inspect the dataset for anomalies and missing values.
 Apply appropriate preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Conduct a thorough analysis using statistical summaries and data visualizations.
 Explore relationships between different variables and understand booking trends.
3. Predictive Modeling
 Implement K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree models to predict booking cancellations.
 Evaluate and fine-tune your models to achieve the best performance.
4. Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE
 Understand how class imbalance in your dataset can skew the results.
 Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset and retrain your models.
 Compare the performance of your models before and after applying SMOTE.
